"Most API requests interact with an Item, a set of credentials (map of key value pairs) associated with a financial institution. Each Item can have many associated Accounts. For each Account, Plaid returns high-level information such as balance, name, and account type. Credit and depository Accounts may also have transactions associated with them.

A single end-user of your application might have accounts at different financial institutions, which means they would have multiple different Items.

Your users create Items through Link, a drop-in module that handles the credential and MFA validation process. Once an Item is created, Link passes a public_token that you exchange for an access_token from your backend app server.

That access_token and item_id uniquely identify the Item. You use the access_token along with your client_id and secret to access products available for an Item and make changes to it over time."
